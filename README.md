# Financial Services Data Transformation Pipelines

## Overview
This project builds scalable data transformation pipelines for financial services data using dbt (data build tool) and Snowflake. It leverages data available in Snowflake's Data Marketplace and implements industry best practices for data engineering and analytics workloads.

## Features
- **Scalable Data Pipelines**: End-to-end ETL/ELT workflows optimized for financial data processing
- **Snowflake Integration**: Leverages Snowflake's cloud data platform capabilities and Data Marketplace
- **dbt Framework**: Implements modular, version-controlled data transformations with built-in documentation
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive testing suite ensuring data validity and integrity
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Streamlined code promotion between development, testing, and production
- **Financial Services Focus**: Prebuilt models tailored to common financial analytics use cases

## Architecture
The project implements a modern data stack architecture:
1. **Source Data**: Financial datasets from Snowflake Data Marketplace and internal systems
2. **Data Loading**: Automated ingestion into Snowflake raw layer
3. **Transformation**: dbt models organized in layers (staging, intermediate, marts)
4. **Testing**: Automated data quality validations
5. **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline for reliable releases
6. **Analytics**: Prepared data models ready for reporting and analysis

## Prerequisites
- Snowflake account with access to Data Marketplace
- dbt Core or dbt Cloud
- Python 3.8+
- Git

## Installation
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial_service_dbt_snowflake.git
cd financial_service_dbt_snowflake

# Set up Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure dbt profile
cp profiles/profiles.yml.example ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
# Edit ~/.dbt/profiles.yml with your Snowflake credentials
```

## Configuration
1. Update `dbt_project.yml` with your project-specific configurations
2. Configure Snowflake connection in your profiles.yml
3. Adjust variables in `dbt_project.yml` to control model behavior

## Usage
```bash
# Run the entire pipeline
dbt run

# Run specific models
dbt run --select marts.financial_reporting

# Run with a specific target (environment)
dbt run --target dev

# Test data quality
dbt test

# Generate documentation
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

## Data Models
This project includes the following key data models:

### Source Layer
- Finance_Economic data from Snowflake Data Marketplace
- Transaction data
- Market reference data
- Regulatory information

### Transformation Models
- Trader profiling and segmentation
- Transaction analytics
- Financial performance indicators

## Data Quality Tests
- Schema validations
- Referential integrity checks
- Business rule validations
- Freshness monitoring
- Reconciliation with source systems

## Environment Management
The pipeline supports multiple environments:
- **Development**: For building and testing new features
- **Staging**: For integration testing
- **Production**: For business-critical reports

## Future Enhancements
- Scheduling dbt data pipelines
- Enhanced visualization connectors
